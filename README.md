# Word Games Backend

This is the backend for word games. For now it's specific to English/Finnish, as that's all I'm really interested in.

It's also my first time writing a backend in Javascript!

The database is intended to be MongoDb. Hopefully I'll get round to dockerising it fully and adding a compose script.
